# JETSON Project NVIDA CUDA

For this project I am working the coding side of a balancing pendulum project. We want to have a robot that will move its position to keep a pendulum balanced at a 90 degree angle. 

## STEPS
# Choose an Image processing API
# Choose a rod as the object we are tracking
# Modify to measure angles 
# Measure mm needed right or left to correct an angle to 90
# Communicate with robot and nvidia
# Create algorithm to constantly update angle
# Create algorithm to constantly send corrective directions to the robot
