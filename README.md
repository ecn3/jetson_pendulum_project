# JETSON Project NVIDA CUDA

For this project I am working the coding side of a balancing pendulum project. We want to have a robot that will move its position to keep a pendulum balanced at a 90 degree angle. 

## STEPS
1. Choose an Image processing API
2. Choose a rod as the object we are tracking
3. Modify to measure angles 
4. Measure mm needed right or left to correct an angle to 90
5. Communicate with robot and nvidia
6. Create algorithm to constantly update angle
7. Create algorithm to constantly send corrective directions to the robot
